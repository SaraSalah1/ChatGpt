7. File name should be: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
8. Commit message: `Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow`
9. Click **"Commit changes"**

### **Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/SaraSalah1/ChatGpt/settings/pages`
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**:
   - **Source:** Select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT gh-pages branch)
3. That's it! No save button needed.

---

### **Step 4: Trigger the Deployment**

The workflow should start automatically, but if it doesn't:

1. Go to **"Actions"** tab
2. Click **"Deploy Vite React App to GitHub Pages"** on the left
3. Click **"Run workflow"** button (top right)
4. Click green **"Run workflow"** button
5. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for it to complete

You'll see:
- 🟡 Yellow dot = Building...
- ✅ Green checkmark = Success! (Your site is live)
- ❌ Red X = Error (tell me and I'll help fix it)

---

### **Step 5: Visit Your Live Site**

After you see the green checkmark:

1. Go to: **`https://sarasalah1.github.io/ChatGpt/`**
2. **Hard refresh:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

**Your app will be live!** 🎉
